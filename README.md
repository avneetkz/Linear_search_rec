# Linear_search_rec
It aims at finding the position of element in an array using the linear search recursive approach. 

Recursion is basically when the function calls itself inside the code to solve the smaller subproblems of the original problems. 

# Code Explanation
Here we are only using the if, else and elif statements. 
Firstly if the size of array is zero, it will return -1.
Else, if the array consist of only one element then it will check whether the element is same as the value required, if not then it will return -1.
Else, if the element at length index is same as the value, it will return the length index i.e. the position of element in array.
Else, if none of the condition is true then it will return the function by decreasing its size by 1 for searching again.
